        <h2>Background: Music and Stress Relief</h2>
        <p>College students often face constant stress due to academic demands, financial pressures, and social expectations. This persistent stress can negatively affect both mental and physical health, leading to anxiety, sleep disturbances, and burnout. The high levels of stress experienced by students can also interfere with concentration, learning, and overall well-being, making it crucial to find effective solutions to manage these challenges.</p>
        <p>One powerful tool for reducing stress is music. Research has shown that music has a unique ability to influence our emotions and physiological responses. Listening to calming music has been proven to lower cortisol levels (the stress hormone), reduce anxiety, and promote relaxation. Additionally, music has a positive impact on heart rate and blood pressure, helping to restore a sense of calm and balance. As a result, music therapy is increasingly recognized as a valuable intervention for stress relief, and its use is growing in both clinical settings and everyday life.</p>
        <p>Given the profound effects of music on stress management, there has been a rise in solutions designed to integrate music therapy into daily routines. However, many existing apps still lack personalized, real-time approaches tailored to individual needs, especially in the context of the unique stressors faced by college students. This leads us to explore current solutions and their limitations.</p>

        <h3>Gap Analysis</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Gap:</strong> Existing apps rely on manual input from users.<br>
                <strong>Proposed Solution:</strong> Real-time biofeedback from fitness trackers to trigger music therapy automatically.</li>
            <li><strong>Gap:</strong> Existing apps do not offer individualized interventions.<br>
                <strong>Proposed Solution:</strong> Personalized music playlists curated by the user to cater to individual preferences.</li>
            <li><strong>Gap:</strong> Existing apps provide a one-size-fits-all approach for all users.<br>
                <strong>Proposed Solution:</strong> Focus on unique stressors faced by college students (e.g., academic pressure, career anxiety) through peer support and a shared playlists feature.</li>

        <h2>Our Problem Statement</h2>
        <p>Given that stress levels can be effectively determined through physiological indicators such as heart rate, how can we use biofeedback to monitor these factors in real-time and leverage personalized music intervention to help reduce stress in college students?</p>

        <h2>Our Research & Findings</h2>
        <p>Through our research, we found that college students experience high levels of stress due to academic pressure, financial concerns, and social expectations. To gain more insight into this issue, we sent out a survey to 15 college students at UCI. The results were revealing, with more than 80% of respondents indicating that they deal with stress levels above the average.</p>

        <p>In addition, all 15 participants reported listening to music as a method to relieve stress, demonstrating the widespread use of music as a coping mechanism among students.</p>

        <p>When asked about wearable devices, about half of the respondents revealed that they currently use a wearable device, such as an Apple Watch or Fitbit, to track their health and wellness, which indicates a growing interest in technology-driven approaches to personal well-being.</p>

        <h2>User-Centered Design</h2>
        <p>With these insights, we began our design process with the usersâ€™ needs in mind. Our approach focuses on personalization, real-time stress detection, and scientifically backed soundscapes to provide a truly effective solution.</p>
